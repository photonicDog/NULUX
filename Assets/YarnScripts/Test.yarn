DR.MELO: Welcome to the quickstart guide for the NOVA interface!
DR.MELO: I'm Doctor Melodii Melomimi, and I'll be showing you how to use this thing.
DR.MELO: The use of this interface can be abstracted into a sort of "rhythm game".
DR.MELO: You must hit keys to the time of the song.
DR.MELO: NOTES will fade onto the screen. The NOTEs color and shape determines what button you press.
DR.MELO: Blue is S, pink is D, green is F. Remember this!
DR.MELO: When a LINE goes over the NOTE, you must hit it.
DR.MELO: Ok, let's try!

DR.MELO: Ok, great job!
DR.MELO: Of course, it's not that simple.
DR.MELO: LINEs come in a lot of varieties. They can spin, grow, shrink, or even be circles.
DR.MELO: It's important to keep your eyes peeled for approaching LINEs.
DR.MELO: Additionally, sometimes, notes may APPROACH LINEs, rather than the other way around.
DR.MELO: Versatile, isn't it?
DR.MELO: Let's show off some of what LINEs can do.
DR.MELO: Get ready!

DR.MELO: Great job!
DR.MELO: NOTEs can also have varieties.
DR.MELO: Some NOTEs have tails. These are HOLD NOTEs. Keep the key down while the LINE is over the tail!
DR.MELO: Releasing at the right time is important, too.
DR.MELO: Additionally, there are sometimes yellow notes called BAR NOTEs.
DR.MELO: They're rare, but very important. Hit them with the space bar!
DR.MELO: Keep these note types in mind when using the NOVA interface.
DR.MELO: Ok, let's try!

DR.MELO: You're doing great!
DR.MELO: Now that we've talked about how to use the device, let's discuss the interface.
DR.MELO: At the top left is the song the device is synchronized to. Don't just use your eyes, use your ears, too!
DR.MELO: At the top right is your score and your combo. Build combo by hitting notes in succession without missing.
DR.MELO: At the bottom is your DRIVE gauge and your PACEMAKER. To successfully use the interface, you'll need to exceed the PACEMAKER.
DR.MELO: Otherwise, it'll spell failure for you.
DR.MELO: On top of that is your OFFSET. This is a more granular display of your average accuracy. Keep the arrow in the middle!
DR.MELO: Let's put it all together!
