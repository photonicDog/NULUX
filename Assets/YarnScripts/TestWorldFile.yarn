DR.MELO: I've been refactoring the entire walkaround to be in 3D so you're going to have to cut me some slack.

NARRATOR: The dim glare of LED strips lines the hall away from your home.
NARRATOR: The air, as always, is filled with the scent of neon and petrichor.
NARRATOR: It's the smell of quiet tension. It's the smell of a spring wound tight, but not tight enough to explode.
<<setemotion Temp MALAISE>>
NARRATOR: Something about the way this place is laid out brings the taste of copper to your tongue.
NARRATOR: You don't hate the place. It just feels foreign. Monolithic.
NARRATOR: It doesn't feel like it was made to be lived in, no matter how many people call it home.
NARRATOR: No matter how badly everybody makes it feel like home.
<<setcamerablocking pullout0>>
NARRATOR: There are voices down the hall, behind doors, living to their fullest.
<<setcamerablocking pullout1>>
NARRATOR: Revelry is common in this place. So common that it's lost its charm on you, like an Elysium-bound soul.
<<setcamerablocking pullout2>>
NARRATOR: There's little left to do but revel in this world - this world at the brink of darkness.
<<setcamerablocking pullout3>>
NARRATOR: After all, this is the Last Station...

???/DR.MELO: R4vyn, do you see what's out the window?
???/R4VYN: Yes, Dr. Melodii. It's the Last Station, of course.
???/R4VYN: Our home.
DR.MELO: Above it, in the sky.
<<switchcam CloserCam>>
R4VYN: The Last Star.
DR.MELO: And around it?
R4VYN: Nothing. Empty space, forever.
R4VYN: That's what last means, of course. No other ones.
R4VYN: ...it really bothers you that much, huh?
DR.MELO: Yes, well. We're used to it.
DR.MELO: Imagine, as it were, living in a place where you could look up and see a thousand stars.
DR.MELO: Dotting the skies in waves and spirals. Nebulae trapped in states of cosmic explosion.
R4VYN: That sounds wild.
R4VYN: And bright. You wouldn't be able to go outside.
DR.MELO: No, but they'd be far away.
DR.MELO: And very small, from our perspective.
R4VYN: Then what's the point?
DR.MELO: Well, around those stars, there might be planets, fed from those stars' energies.
DR.MELO: And on those planets, life.
DR.MELO: Free to roam thousands and thousands of miles, unconstrained by concrete walls and an artificial atmosphere.
DR.MELO: Doesn't that sound grand, R4vyn? Doesn't that sound like a dream someone could dedicate their life to?
R4VYN: I guess.
R4VYN: I could see someone going through a lot of trouble to make that a reality.

THINKING/TEMP: This post sucks. This post sucks. This post is... okay.. but this post sucks.
NARRATOR: You continue to ambiently drag your thumbs across the touchscreen, as if this will change the quality of the contents rendered on them in any noticeable way.
NARRATOR: It’s 12:00 PM and you haven’t gotten out of bed. Your shorts are noticeably stuck to your legs with sweat, not on account of the heat, but on account of the lack of movement.
NARRATOR: You’re too uncomfortable to relax, and yet, you’re not even slightly motivated to try and find something worthwhile to do.
NARRATOR: So here you are, scrolling through your social media as your eyes continue to adjust to the waking world.
NARRATOR: Browsing. "Chilling". Waiting.
THINKING/TEMP: I hate this app.
NARRATOR: Your name is Temp, and you genuinely have nothing going on in your life.
NARRATOR: You are 23 years old. Your sole personality trait is pretty much your enjoyment of ska music. You’re pretty alright at dancing.
NARRATOR: You live with six other people in what could be generously referred to as a "frat house" based around your mutual enjoyment of ska music, which seems to be everyone else’s sole personality trait as well, which makes for riveting and surprisingly heated living room conversation.
NARRATOR: Yeah. That's about it.
NARRATOR: You turn your phone screen off with an undeserved amount of frustration.
THINKING/TEMP: This timeline womps. I’m gonna hit snooze an-
<<playsfx sfx_skaphone>>
NARRATOR: You then nearly drop your phone as it rings. You’ve got a call.
<<switchsprite Bed phone>>
TEMP: Huh?
TEMP: Uh, hello?
???/R4VYN: Is this Temp?
TEMP: Yeah?
???/R4VYN: Ok, cool.
TEMP: ...

TEMP: Whooooo… is this...?
???/R4VYN: Oh, uh. I’m R4vyn.
R4VYN: With a 4.
TEMP: Oh. Neat. 
TEMP: Soooo…
R4VYN: What is it?
R4VYN: ...
R4VYN: Oh, right.
R4VYN: You’re wanted down at the labs. I’ll be there shortly to escort you down.
TEMP: Huh?
TEMP: Am I in trouble?
R4VYN: No. Maybe? Depends.
R4VYN: The doc wants you for a "very special opportunity".
R4VYN: It’s really important, so... you should get over there as soon as possible.
TEMP: Alright.
TEMP: I guess that’s fine.

R4VYN: Hi.
R4VYN: Um.
TEMP: Oh, we're just cutting corners to avoid showing more unfinished content, now.
TEMP+CONCERNED: That's pretty rude.
TEMP+CONCERNED: I wanted to do a cool elevator ride scene. Maybe meet another pair of major characters.
R4VYN: Don't blame me!
R4VYN: I...
R4VYN: Uhh...
R4VYN: We're just going to do the tutorial now.
